# ESPHome changed source files

### UART

UART-directory contains file that has needed change for ESPHome UART-component to work with ESP-IDF v5.2.1. In ESP-IDF 5.2.1 the definition of uart_port_t changed from typedef int to enum.

### ADC

ADC-directory contains files that has needed changes for ESPHome ADC-component to work with ESP-IDF v5.2.1 and ESP32-C6. Some newer chips have only 1 ADC and ESP32-C6 is not included in header and source files so compile fails without these changes in ESPHome environment.

#### Just copy files to their corresponding locations and all should be fine.

### Folder named 'python3.12' might differ on your install depending on your installed python version!!!
